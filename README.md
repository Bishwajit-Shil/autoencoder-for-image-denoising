Introduction

This example demonstrates how to implement a deep convolutional autoencoder for image denoising, mapping noisy digits images from the MNIST dataset to clean digits images. This implementation is based on an original blog post titled Building Autoencoders in Keras by Fran√ßois Chollet.
